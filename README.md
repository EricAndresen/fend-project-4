# Project 4 - Add Tests to Feed Reader

This is a simple RSS reader provided as part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Certificate.

In this exercise I added jasmine test to a functioning RSS feedreader. Code that was provided is commented in feedreader.js.

### Instructions

To run, simply open index.html. All tests will automatically run and display at the bottom of the page.

_Note: Jasmine 2.1.2 was provided by default, so older syntax is used for async tests (e.g. done() instead of async / await)_
