# Project 4 - Add Tests to Feed Reader

This is a simple RSS reader provided as part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Certificate.

In this excercise I added tests in jasmine.js according to the insructions provided (see comments in feedreader.js).

To run, simply open index.html and see the jasmine read-out at the bottom of the page and inspect the tests in feedreader.js.

Note: Jasmine 2.1.2 was provided by default, so older syntax is used for async tests (e.g. done() instead of async / await).
