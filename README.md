# Project

This is a project for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Certificate.

All code was provided, except for feedreader.js where instructions were given to write tests for the application.

To run simply open index.html and see the jasmine read-out at the bottom of the page.

Note: Jasmine 2.1.2 is used, thus older syntax is used for async tests (e.g. done() instead of async / await).
